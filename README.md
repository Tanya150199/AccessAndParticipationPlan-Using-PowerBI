# Access and Participation Plan Dashboard

## Introduction

üìäüöÄ Welcome to the Access and Participation Plan (APP) dashboard project. This dashboard is developed to provide a comprehensive tool for tracking and promoting student access, success, and progression metrics, particularly focusing on underprivileged student groups. The data for this project was collected from a survey sent to university students, receiving close to 2000 responses. As a Student Data Analyst, I meticulously crafted this Power BI dashboard to harness data-driven insights and drive impactful educational equity strategies throughout the institution. This formal exploration aims to showcase the strategic application of data analytics in addressing organizational needs and enhancing decision-making processes within the realm of education. ü§ùüéì

## Understanding Educational Equity Requirements ü§ùüìä

### Approach:
In the initial stages of data analysis, my focus was on active listening and prioritizing collaboration with university stakeholders. This strategic partnership approach involved asking pertinent questions to align solutions with the institution's short and long-term educational equity goals.

### Key Areas of Focus:
1. **Student Access:**
   - **Goal:** Understand the factors influencing students' decisions to pursue higher education.
   - **Analysis:** Identify primary sources of guidance and support, barriers faced during course selection, and key factors affecting university selection.

2. **Student Continuation:**
   - **Goal:** Monitor student retention and engagement.
   - **Analysis:** Evaluate the impact of academic advisors, course flexibility, and the overall teaching and learning experience on student persistence.

3. **Student Completion:**
   - **Goal:** Identify factors that influence successful course completion.
   - **Analysis:** Examine the availability of financial support, awareness of mental health services, and the role of extracurricular activities.

4. **Student Attainment:**
   - **Goal:** Analyze academic achievements and the factors that contribute to them.
   - **Analysis:** Assess the impact of course flexibility, outreach schemes, assessment and examination experiences, and the availability of university spaces.

5. **Student Progression:**
   - **Goal:** Understand post-graduation outcomes and career progression.
   - **Analysis:** Investigate the factors affecting long-term educational and career decisions, the role of academic advisors, and the adequacy of university spaces in supporting progression.

## The Dashboard

- **Template Creation for Automation:**
  - Developed dynamic templates to automate the preprocessing pipeline, ensuring adaptability to future datasets. This approach minimizes repetitive preprocessing tasks and enhances the scalability of the dashboard.

- **Function Utilization:**
  - Streamlined and automated common data processing steps, facilitating efficient and consistent data preparation for Power BI. This standardization ensures reliable and repeatable insights across various datasets.

- **DAX Measures Implementation:**
  - Created comprehensive DAX measures to capture key metrics, enabling quick and flexible visualization creation on the Power BI dashboard. This robust foundation supports insightful data representation.

- **Strategic UI Design:**
  - Adopted a user-centric approach by strategically placing the most critical insights in prominent areas, optimizing the user's immediate visual attention. This design enhances the user experience by providing quick access to essential information.

- **Interactive Filters:**
  - Integrated interactive filters based on demographic variables such as student category, ethnicity, gender, and more. These filters empower users to dynamically explore and analyze data, enhancing usability and tailored insights.

- **Consistent Aesthetics and Naming Conventions:**
  - Adhered to consistent aesthetics and naming conventions for charts, graphs, and filters, promoting a visually cohesive and user-friendly dashboard. This facilitates ease of understanding and navigation for users.

## Conclusion

Moreover, the dashboard facilitates communication with non-technical stakeholders by offering intuitive filters for sorting survey responses based on various demographic variables. This allows university administrators and SU members to gain nuanced insights into educational trends across different student demographics, informing targeted interventions and strategies. Overall, the Access and Participation Plan dashboard represents a powerful tool for driving positive change and fostering a culture of educational equity within the institution. By leveraging data to inform decision-making and engage stakeholders, the university can lead by example and inspire meaningful action towards a more inclusive and supportive educational environment. üìäüí°ü§ù
