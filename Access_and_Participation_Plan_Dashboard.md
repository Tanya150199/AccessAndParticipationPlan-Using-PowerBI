# Access and Participation Plan dashboard

The Access and Participation Plan (APP) dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for tracking and promoting student access, success, and progression metrics, particularly focusing on underprivileged student groups. As a Student Data Analyst, my role in developing this dashboard was pivotal in harnessing data-driven insights to drive impactful educational equity strategies throughout the institution.

The dashboard covers five key components:

Access: Visualizes data on guidance and support views, barriers faced during course selection, and factors affecting university selection. This helps identify the challenges and influences on students' decisions to pursue higher education.

Continuation: Monitors the persistence of students in their studies, highlighting support systems and interventions that facilitate ongoing student engagement and retention.

Completion: Tracks student completion rates, providing insights into the factors that contribute to students successfully finishing their courses. This includes analyzing course diversity and flexibility impact on completion.

Attainment: Focuses on the academic achievements of students, identifying the attributes that influence their success and areas that require additional support to improve outcomes.

Progression: Examines the progression of students post-graduation, looking at their career paths, further education opportunities, and overall impact of their university experience on their future endeavors.

This dashboard is a vital tool for educators and administrators aiming to enhance educational equity and improve student outcomes by leveraging data-driven strategies.
